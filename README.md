# AppCliente
A simple app to communicate via Socket with the Server the teacher presented to us. It uses NashhornScriptEngine JS processor for the logic (so it's not hardcoded xD), and the properties to connect are in a properties file. I inject some classes at the JS so it's possible to call ServerSide functions from the JS script.

# Estrutura_De_Dados
Todo: Explain that.
